## What's this?
This is an emulator for the Kosmos CP1 "Computer Praxis" experimental kit that
was sold in german-speaking Europe in the early 80s of the last century.

The Kosmos CP1 was intended to introduce children to programming. To do so, it
used a virtual machine with a very simple machine language. Programs were
written in Assembler, and then had to be manually translated to op-codes.
The computer was accompanied by a pretty good manual that not only explained
the virtual machine, but also contained a well written introduction to
the inner workings of a computer.

Unlike other programs, kosmos-cp1 does not only simulate the Kosmos CP1's
virtual machine, but emulates the underlying hardware (an Intel 8049 and an
Intel 8155).

## What is currently emulated?
The current version emulates the base unit, without any extensions. I'm
planning to add support for the "CP5" memory extensions as well as the "CP2"
cassette interface.
